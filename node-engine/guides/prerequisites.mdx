description: Find out what you need to run Atlas Node Engine.
---

The following tools are required to use Node Engine.

- A WP Engine [Atlas](https://wpengine.com/atlas) account.
- A supported version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) on your local machine. The supported versions of Node.js are **12, 14, and 16**. Specifying a Node version below the minimum supported version will default to the minimum supported version (12); setting a higher version will default to the maximum supported version (16). 
- A terminal application on your local machine.
- A local installation of [Git].
- An account with a Git hosting service such as GitHub or Bitbucket. 
- (Optional) WP Engine Headless CLI tool ([install](../introduction#install-the-atlas-cli)). Only needed if you plan on deploying your first app using Atlas CLI.

## Git

To make sure you have Git installed on your computer, open a terminal application and enter `git --version`. You should receive a response similar to `git version <version-number>`.

If you don't have Git installed, follow the instructions on GitHub's website (Install Git)(https://github.com/git-guides/install-git).

Atlas also requires an account through [GitHub](https://github.com/), where you can host the code for your front-end application. Please sign-up before beginning the steps in this guide.

After you've signed up for GitHub, go back to your terminal application. Follow the steps in the [Generate a new SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) page on GitHub.

## Node.js

Atlas supports [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)-based applications. The supported versions of Node.js are **12, 14, and 16**. 

### For current Node.js users

Specify a Node.js version in the `package.json` file on your front-end application. If this is your first time building a node application, we'll return to this file later.

If you have a current front-end application you wish to use, enter the following in your `package.json` file.

```json
{
  "engines": {
    "node": "16.00.0"
  }
}
```

Specifying a Node version below the minimum supported version will default to the minimum supported version (12); setting a higher version will default to the maximum supported version (16). 

If no version is specified, your app will be built with current default version (16). To ensure your project is built with a version of your choice, make sure to include your desired settings in "engines" section of your package.json. 

**Note:** Only major versions are available - minor and patch versions will be rounded to a given major version

### Install Node.js 

You can install a supported version from the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) website.

However, we recommend using `nvm` to install Node.js since this will allow you to switch freely between versions.

1. In your terminal application, install `nvm` by entering `curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.37.2/install.sh | bash`.

2. Restart your terminal and add the proper `nvm` settings to your `./bashrc`[Linux or Git Bash] or `.zshrc`[MacOS]. You can do this by:

   a. Open a terminal application. Enter `open ~/.zshrc` or `open ~/.bashrc`. A text editor appears.
   b. In the editor, copy the following into your `.zshrc` or `.bashrc` file. 
      
      ```
      export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
      [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
      [ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"  # This loads nvm bash_completion
      ```
   c. Save your `.zshrc` or `.bashrc` file and restart your terminal.

3. Make sure that nvm is installed. Enter `nvm --version` 

4. In terminal, enter `nvm install <node-version-number>` to install your chosen version of Node.js.
