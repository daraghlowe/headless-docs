# Getting Started on Atlas Node Engine

In this guide, you'll learn the basics of deploying apps on the WP Engine Headless Platform.

Requirements:

- A WP Engine [Atlas](https://wpengine.com/atlas) account
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). We recommend using `nvm` to install Node.js.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- (Optional) WP Engine Headless CLI tool ([install](../introduction#install-the-atlas-cli)). Only needed if you plan on deploying your first app using Atlas CLI.

What this guide covers:

- [Prerequisites](./prerequisites)
- [Headless Concepts](./headless-concepts)
- [Supported apps](#supported-apps)
- [Creating your first app](./create-app)
- [Deploying your first app](./deployment)
- [Making changes to your app (dev workflow)](./developer-workflow)

This guide does **not** cover how to add a custom domain. Custom domains require that you have an Atlas account with a `production` environment. Contact the WP Engine Atlas team to get set up with custom domains.
