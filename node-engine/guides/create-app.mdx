The best way to understand how a Headless CMS operates is to create a simple application and deploy it. This tutorial uses Faust.js, WPEngine's open-source [headless framework](https://github.com/wpengine/faustjs), and Next.js to create a simple application.

## Setup WordPress

1. Make a WordPress site. Your WordPress site is seperate from the site created when you create your app. You should have a site and an Atlas account through WPEngine in the [User Portal](https://my.wpengine.com). Navigate to the site environment you want to use for your backend, and click the WP Admin link at the top of the page. This will log you into WP Admin, where the setup for the framework plugin and WPGraphQL occurs.
1. Download the [wpe-headless plugin](https://wp-product-info.wpesvc.net/v1/plugins/wpe-headless?download). Then, upload and activate the plugin from within the WordPress admin panel.
1. Install [WP GraphQL](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-graphql/) from the [WordPress Plugin Directory](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-graphql/). You can also automatically install WPGraphQL from the `wpe-headless` plugin's **settings** page.

## Create a Next.js App using the [Getting Started Example](https://developers.wpengine.com/docs/faustjs/next/getting-started)

Install our Next.js Getting Started example using the following command:

### On MacOS, Linux, or WSL (bash):

```bash
npx create-next-app \
    -e https://github.com/wpengine/faustjs/tree/canary \
    --example-path examples/next/getting-started \
    --use-npm \
    my-app
cd my-app
```

### On Windows with Powershell:

```ps
npx create-next-app `
    -e https://github.com/wpengine/faustjs/tree/canary `
    --example-path examples/next/getting-started `
    --use-npm `
    my-app && cd my-app
```

Now, copy the sample environment template:

```bash
cp .env.local.sample .env.local
```

Finally, run the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You can now visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the example site!

Currently, the posts and pages you see are coming from our WordPress site at [https://headlessfw.wpengine.com](https://headlessfw.wpengine.com). In the next step, we'll show you how to hook up your own WordPress site.

## Connecting your WordPress site

The example app above loads WordPress content from the demo site at [https://headlessfw.wpengine.com](https://headlessfw.wpengine.com).

Open the `.env.local` file you created earlier. It should look something like this:

```bash
# Your WordPress site URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_WORDPRESS_URL=https://headlessfw.wpengine.com

# Plugin secret found in WordPress Settings->Headless
WP_HEADLESS_SECRET=YOUR_PLUGIN_SECRET
```

Update the `NEXT_PUBLIC_WORDPRESS_URL` value with your WordPress site URL (be sure to include `http://` or `https://`).

Additionally, update the `WP_HEADLESS_SECRET` value with the secret key found in Settings â†’ Headless in your WordPress admin panel to support previews.

Now, if you are still running the dev server, you can navigate back to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and see your app running while connected to your WordPress site!

If you want to continue building the functionality of your headless WordPress site, you can follow our [Faust.js tutorial](https://faustjs.org/docs/tutorial/basic-headless-site).

Next, let's deploy the app to the Headless Platform. ðŸš€
