## Introduction

Welcome to the WP Engine Headless Platform for WordPress, Atlas!

If you're new to headless, this is the place to start. If you've created headless sites before, head over to our [Getting Started Guide](./guides/getting-started).

### What is Headless WordPress?

When we talk about headless with WordPress, we mean using WordPress for content creation but not for front-end rendering. Instead of using traditional WordPress themes, you develop your front-end using a JavaScript framework like React. A separate server hosts the front-end from the WordPress instance.

Since the front-end is responsible for displaying content to the end-user, it needs to access the content. To do that, it utilized the WordPress REST API or GraphQL via [WPGraphQL](https://www.wpgraphql.com/).

### Why Headless?

Headless is gaining momentum for a few reasons:

- **Developer Choice** - Developers want to use modern frameworks like React to build sites and applications, and headless enables that possibility.
- **Scalability** - A headless WordPress site scales more manageably because WordPress does not hold sole responsibility for rendering a site.
- **Security** - Removing the responsibility of rendering from WordPress minimizes the surface area for attacks. Now, you can choose only to expose the API to the internet.
- **Integrations** - The WordPress community provides many integrations through plugins, but those plugins don't always work well together. In a headless instance, you have more control over your integrations because most services support integrating with JavaScript and Node.js.

### Hosting Your Headless Apps

WordPress runs on PHP, but your headless site will likely utilize [Node](https://nodejs.org/). At the very least, you'll use Node and NPM to manage JavaScript dependencies and bundle your applications (i.e., webpack).

At WP Engine, we have a Node hosting platform. The platform works differently than our WordPress platform. With WordPress, you get a server that you can FTP or SSH into, but with Node, the infrastructure is opaque to you. All you need to do is point our platform to a GitHub repo, and we'll watch the repo and deploy it automatically!

## WP Engine Headless Concepts

The Node hosting platform is part of the solution for a headless site. The other part is the WordPress instance. These two work together to make up your site.

We call the Node portion of your site an **app**. An app can have _n_ number of **environments**. Let's explore these concepts.

### Apps and Environments

An **app** is a logical container of all of your _environments_ for the Node portion of your site. An app can have multiple _environments_ like production, staging, and development.

Apps link to a single GitHub repository (i.e., https://github.com/matt-landers/headless-wpe). Environments link to a branch within the repository of the app. It's up to you to decide which branch relates to which environment. For example, it's common for your _main_ branch to link to your production environment.

Here's an example configuration for a typical app with a Production and Development environment.

```json
{
  "name": "MyHeadlessApp",
  "repo": "matt-landers/headless-wpe",
  "region": "US-C",
  "environments": [
    {
      "name": "Production",
      "branch": "main",
      "wp_environment_name": "headlesswpe",
      "domains": ["yourdomain.com"],
      "env_variables": [
        { "key": "WORDPRESS_URL", "value": "https://headlesswpe.wpengine.com" }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "Development",
      "branch": "dev",
      "wp_environment_name": "headlesswpe-dev",
      "env_variables": [
        {
          "key": "WORDPRESS_URL",
          "value": "https://headlesswpe-dev.wpengine.com"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The **app** has three properties:

- `name` - the name of your app which you choose.
- `repo` - the GitHub repository linked to your app.
- `region` - the region where you want your app hosted (cannot be modified)
  - `EU-W` - Europe West
  - `UK` - United Kingdom
  - `US-C` - US Central
  - `AUS-SE` - Australia Southeast
- `environments` - an array of environments that your app contains.
  - Each environment is deployed to the platform and receives a unique URL.

Each **environment** has the following properties:

- `name` - the name you choose for the environment.
- `branch` - a branch that exists in the GitHub repo linked to the app.
- `wp_environment_name` - the name of the WordPress environment (found in the user portal) that you want to link to your Node environment.
- `env_variables` (optional) - an array of environment variables that you want to be available at build-time and runtime as OS environment variables.
  - In Node, you can access these variables with `process.env`.
  - Environment variables help store information needed to build or run your application, like API keys/secrets.
- `domains` - (optional) If you want to connect a custom domain, you need to configure your domain one of 2 ways. Custom domains require a `production` environment.
  - Root CNAME pointed to `js.wpenginepowered.com`
  - A records with the following IPs:
    - `141.193.213.10`
    - `141.193.213.11`

### Connecting Your WordPress Backend

Each app environment pairs with a WordPress backend. In the [WP Engine User Portal](https://my.wpengine.com), the WordPress equivalent to an _app_ is a _site_. A site has environments just like apps. Therefore, each _app environment_ needs to pair with a `_site environment_` via the site's environment id found in the user portal. You make the connection by setting the `wp_environment_name` property for each environment in your app config.

The `wp_environment_name` property is **required** as it provides the authorization context for the environment, which determines which users have access to modify and deploy the _app environment_.

## Install the Atlas CLI

Atlas CLI gives you access to all the commands needed to spin up your first Headless application. `npm` is required to install the CLI.

**NOTE:** With version 0.1.4 released March 18, 2021, Atlas CLI no longer requires the `alpha` syntax (i.e., `wpe alpha apps`). If you are still using a previous version of Atlas CLI, run through these steps to use commands without `alpha`.

To install, enter:

```bash
npm i @wpengine/headless-cli -g
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
wpe --version
```

If the installation was successful, your terminal applications returns:

```bash
wpe version vX.X.X
```
NOTE: In case your version is lower than `1.0.0` (e.g. 0.9.9) you need to upgrade your CLI using `npm i @wpengine/headless-cli -g` command. Versions lower than `1.0.0` will stop being supported starting 09/30/2021.

You'll now be able to follow the other guides and tutorials on this site, as well as use any command in the [CLI reference](./reference/cli/wpe).
