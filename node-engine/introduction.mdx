## Introduction

Welcome to the WP Engine Headless Platform for WordPress, Atlas!

If you're new to headless, this is the place to start. If you've created headless sites before, head over to our [Getting Started Guide](./guides/getting-started).

### What is Headless WordPress?

When we talk about headless with WordPress, we mean using WordPress for content creation but not for front-end rendering. Instead of using traditional WordPress themes, you develop your front-end using a JavaScript framework like React. A separate server hosts the front-end from the WordPress instance.

Since the front-end is responsible for displaying content to the end-user, it needs to access the content. To do that, it utilized the WordPress REST API or GraphQL via [WPGraphQL](https://www.wpgraphql.com/).

### Why Headless?

Headless is gaining momentum for a few reasons:

- **Developer Choice** - Developers want to use modern frameworks like React to build sites and applications, and headless enables that possibility.
- **Scalability** - A headless WordPress site scales more manageably because WordPress does not hold sole responsibility for rendering a site.
- **Security** - Removing the responsibility of rendering from WordPress minimizes the surface area for attacks. Now, you can choose only to expose the API to the internet.
- **Integrations** - The WordPress community provides many integrations through plugins, but those plugins don't always work well together. In a headless instance, you have more control over your integrations because most services support integrating with JavaScript and Node.js.
