title: Local App Development Overview
description: Learn how to develop Atlas headless WordPress sites locally
---

This guide covers how to start developing your Atlas app locally. In the previous [Getting Started](../getting-started/overview) guide, you should have identified a GitHub repository for you Atlas app and deployed that app to the Atlas platform.  

This guide will build on those steps and help you work on your app locally. In particular,  you'll learn:

1. What [prerequisites](./prerequisites) are required for local development
1. How to [clone and configure your frontend JavaScript app](./frontend-app-config) locally
1. How to [configure your local WordPress site](./wordpress-site-config) locally

After going through it, you'll be set up to work on your Atlas app locally.
