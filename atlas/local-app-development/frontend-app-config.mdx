description: How to configure your frontend app for local development
---

This page will guide you through configuring your Atlas frontend JavaScript application for local development. You'll learn how to:

1. [Clone the project repository to your machine](#clone-repo)
1. [Define environment variables](#define-environment-variables)
1. [Install the project dependencies and start the app](#install-dependencies-and-start-app)

## 1. Clone Repo

Visit the GitHub repository page for your frontend JavaScript app.

[Clone the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) to your local machine.

## 2. Define Environment Variables

Open the codebase in a code editor.

### Create Environment Variables File

Create a file in the root directory of the project where you can define environment variables. The name of this file varies depending on the JavaScript framework you're using.

- Faust.js, Next.js and SvelteKit apps typically use `.env.local`
- Gatsby apps typically use `.env.development`
- Nuxt.js environment variables are typically defined inside of your `nuxt.config.js` file, or in a `.env` file if you're using the `@nuxtjs/dotenv` module.

If you're using another framework, please reference your framework's documentation to learn how to define environment variables.

### Add Variables to Environment Variables File

1. In a web browser, log into the WP Engine [User Portal](https://my.wpengine.com/atlas). Click `Atlas` in the sidebar, then click on the name of the Atlas app associated with this project.

2. Click `Manage variables` under the `Atlas environment variables` heading.

3. On the `Variables` page that opens, toggle the `Hide all values` control to the `off` position.

4. Copy and paste the `Key` and `Value` pairs for each environment variable into your local environment variables file.

As an example, if your app has these two environment variables listed in the User Portal:

```
| Key                       | Value                        |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| NEXT_PUBLIC_WORDPRESS_URL | https://my-site.wpengine.com |
| MY_API_SECRET             | ABC123                       |
```

You would need to add them to your environment variables file (`.env.local`/`.env.development`/other) in this format:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_WORDPRESS_URL=https://my-site.wpengine.com
MY_API_SECRET=ABC123
```

### Replace WordPress Site URL

One of your environment variables will be the URL of the WordPress site where the app sources its data. If you want the app to source its data from your local WordPress site instead, replace this value with the URL of your local WordPress site.

As an example, if your project has a `NEXT_PUBLIC_WORDPRESS_URL` environment variable and your local WordPress site URL is `http://my-site.local`, then that environment variable should be updated to `NEXT_PUBLIC_WORDPRESS_URL=http://my-site.local`.

When finished, save the environment variables file.

## 3. Install Dependencies and Start App

Run `npm install` to install the frontend app's NPM dependencies.

Make sure your local WordPress site is up and running, then run the command to start your JavaScript app in development mode (typically `npm run dev`).

The JavaScript app should now be running locally, and sourcing its data from your local WordPress site. You can now proceed with local site development. Changes to your frontend app that you commit and merge into the `main` branch of your GitHub repo will be automatically deployed.
