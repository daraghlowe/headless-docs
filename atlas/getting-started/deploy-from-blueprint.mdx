## Set your repository settings

Learn how to connect an Atlas application to a GitHub repository, so updates you make deploy automatically.

Atlas supports Node.js applications using popular frameworks like [Faust.js](https://faustjs.org/), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/), [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/), etc.

### 1. Connect to GitHub

Connect your GitHub account so you can connect a repo or clone Atlas blueprints.

1. In the `Repository Settings` view, select `Connect`.

2. GitHub opens in another tab of your web browser. Give WP Engine permission to access your repositories.

After Atlas connects to your GitHub account, the `Connect` button indicates that you are `Connected`. A list of repositories associated with your GitHub account appears.

### Select a repository

Now that GitHub is connected, it's time to connect your repository.

#### Starting from a blueprint

If you chose “Start with Blueprint”, clone the Atlas Blueprint repo and link it to Atlas:

1. Select `Clone Blueprint`. This option opens another tab in GitHub.

2. On the `Create a new repository` page, set your new git repository settings.

- Under `Owner`, select the username you associated with your repository.
- For `Repository name`, enter a name in a format similar to `repository-name`. Avoid capitalization or spaces to make it easy to navigate your repository in the future.
- (Optional) Enter a `description` for your repository.
- Choose whether to make your repository `Public` or `Private`.
- Leave `Include all branches` unchecked.

3. With your new repository named, select `Create repository from template`.

4. Navigate back to the WP Engine User Portal by closing the GitHub tab. Select your new repository from the repository list when it refreshes.

5. Select `Continue` and move on to [App Settings](./app-settings).

#### Using an existing app

If you chose “Pull from repo”, first make sure that you've pushed your application's code to your GitHub repository. If you're not familiar with pushing code to a GitHub repository, see this guide: [Adding an existing project to GitHub using the command line](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/importing-your-projects-to-github/importing-source-code-to-github/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line).

Your application needs to include a `wpe-build` script in the [`scripts`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/using-npm/scripts) field in your project's `package.json` file. It should execute the build command for your project. This is the script that the Atlas platform will execute when it builds your app.

For example, the `package.json` file for a Faust.js or Next.js app would need to be updated as shown below.

```json
  "scripts": {
    "wpe-build": "next build",
    // etc.
  },
```

If you don't know what command needs to be run to build your app, please refer to your JavaScript framework's documentation.

1. Select `Add repository`. A list of repositories in your GitHub account appears.

2. From the list of repositories, select the one with your application's code.

3. Select `Continue`. The WP Engine Settings page appears.

## 

On this page, you'll give your Atlas app a name and assign it to a geographic region.

## Set your application settings

On the `WP Engine Settings` screen:

1. Fill out a name for your application. We recommend choosing a name similar to your GitHub repository's name. The application name cannot be changed once it has been deployed. 

2. Select a region for your application. The region you select will be used for all of your app's environments (production/staging/etc.) and cannot be changed once your Atlas application has been deployed.

3. Click `Continue`.

## Configure the environment

### Set Up Environment

1. From the list of your repository's branches, select the branch you want to base your environment on. Whenever changes are pushed to this branch, your app will be automatically re-deployed.

Examples:

- If you want to create a production environment, you could use your repo's `main` branch
- If you want to create a staging environment, you could use your repository's `staging` branch

![Select a branch](./assets/img/select-branch.png)

2. Enter a name for your Atlas environment. The name should represent how you intend to use the environment. For example, enter something like `prod` if it's a production environment, `staging` if it's a staging environment, etc.

3. Every headless environment is associated with a WordPress environment. Choose either:

   - `I already have a WordPress environment`: Use a WordPress site from your WP Engine account. Select the search bar and search for the name of your WordPress site.
   - `I want to create a new WordPress environment`: WP Engine makes a new WordPress site and links it to your application. In the box, enter a name for your new WordPress site.

![Link to WordPress](./assets/img/link-to-wordpress.png)

4. In order for your WordPress environment to become "headless", Atlas installs the [WP GraphQL](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-graphql/) and [Atlas Content Modeler](https://wordpress.org/plugins/atlas-content-modeler/) plugins.

If you're using the Faust.js Starter Kit or an existing Faust.js app repository, check the `I am using Faust.js` checkbox. This will ensure that the [FaustWP](https://wordpress.org/plugins/faustwp/) plugin is also installed.

![Select Faust.js Plugin](./assets/img/faustjs.png)

**NOTE:** If you're using an existing application (rather than the Faust.js Starter Kit), see the [Environment variables (Optional)](#environment-variables--optional-) section below to set up environment variables before proceeding with the steps below.

5. Select `Create App`.

6. The Atlas app details page appears. When Atlas completes building your application, a checkmark appears under `Last Build`.

![Headless App Building](./assets/img/portal-app-building.png)

7. To visit your headless WordPress app once the first deploy finishes, click the link under the `Atlas URL` heading. Your Atlas app opens in a new browser tab. Enjoy!

![First app deployed](./assets/img/first-app-deployed.png)

### Set Environment Variables (Optional)

To add environment variables for your app, click `Add environment variable`.

Enter the `Key` and `Value` pairs for each environment variable.

For example, you may need to add a `NEXT_PUBLIC_WORDPRESS_URL` key with a URL as its value to specify which WordPress site should be used as the data source for the app. You may also need to specify additional environment variables to store sensitive data such as API keys and secrets.

Please refer to your JavaScript framework's documentation if you're unsure what environment variables are required for your app.
