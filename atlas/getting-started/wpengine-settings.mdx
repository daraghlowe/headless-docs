With your [Repository Settings](./set-repository-settings) done, you can now give your application a name and a region.


## Choose name and region 

On the **WP Engine Settings** screen:

1. Fill out a name for your application. We recommend choosing name similar to your GitHub repository's name.

2. Select a region for application. Try to pick a region closest to where you think your application will be used. The region you select will be used for all environments within the application, and cannot be changed once your Atlas application deploys.

3. If you're satisfied with your name and region, select **Continue**.

## Next Step

With your repository settings set and your app named, there's one last step before your application is ready to deploy. Go to [Environments](./environments).
