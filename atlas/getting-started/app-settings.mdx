On this page, you'll give your Atlas app a name and assign it to a geographic region.

## Choose Name and Region

On the `WP Engine Settings` screen:

1. Fill out a name for your application. We recommend choosing a name similar to your GitHub repository's name.

2. Select a region for your application. The region you select will be used for all of your app's environments (production/staging/etc.) and cannot be changed once your Atlas application has been deployed.

3. Click `Continue`.
