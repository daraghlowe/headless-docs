title: Getting Started on Atlas
description: Start using the WP Engine Headless Platform, Atlas.
---

No matter where you are in your Headless journey, Atlas provides two starting points for you to get your first up running in Atlas. Before you get started, make sure you have:

- A WP Engine [Atlas](https://wpengine.com/atlas) account.
- A [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.


Whether you're using an existing app or creating one with Faust.js, every Atlas app is deployed with the same three steps.

1. Log into [Atlas](https://wpengine.com/atlas). Select the **Atlas** tab. 

2. From the Atlas site view, select **Create app**.

From there, you have two options:

- If you've never created a front-end application before or want to use our Faust.js starter kit, go to the [Use the Faust.js starter kit](./set-repository-settings#use-the-faustjs-starter-kit).
- If you have an existing front-end application, go to [Use an existing repo](./set-repository-settings#use-an-existing-repo).
