**NOTE:**: Already have an existing app or repository you want to use? Connect your Atlas account to GitHub and then go to [Use an existing repo](./use-an-existing-repo).

Most Atlas headless apps are Node.js applications. Node.js is the backbone many of the common front-end frameworks, like Vue, Nuxt, or Next. 

If you're not that familiar with front end frameworks, Atlas provides a starter kit using WP Engine's own framework, [Faust.js](https://faustjs.org/). However, you can also use an existing application, as long as your code base is stored in GitHub.

This page covers the first step in deploying your application through the Atlas User Portal, setting your repository settings.


## Connect to GitHub

Before we can create an Atlas application, you must connect your GitHub account.

1. In the **Repository Settings** view, select **Connect**. 
2. GitHub opens in another tab of your web browser. Give WP Engine permission to access your repositories.

After permission is granted, the **Connect** button indicates that you are **Connected** and a list of repositories associated with your GitHub account appears.

## Use the Faust.js starter kit

If you're not that familiar with front end frameworks, Atlas provides a starter kit using WP Engine's own framework, [Faust.js](https://faustjs.org/).

To use the Faust.js starter kit.

1. Select **Clone Faust.js** starter. This option opens another tab in GitHub.

2. In the **Create a new repository** page, set the settings for your new Git repository. 
  - Under **Owner**, select the username you associated with your repository.
  - For **Repository name**, enter a name in a format similar to `repository-name`. Avoid capitalization or spaces to make it easy to navigate to your repository in the future.
  - (Optional) Enter a **description** for your repository.
  - Choose whether to make your repository **Public** or **Private**.
  - Leave **Include all branches** unchecked.

3. With your new repository named, select **Create repository** from template.

4. Navigate back to the Atlas User Portal. Select your new repository from the repository list.  

5. Select **Continue** and move on to [WP Engine Settings](./wpengine-settings)

## Use an existing app 

Before you use an existing app, make sure that you've pushed your application's code to GitHub. Afterwards, you can connect your GitHub account and repository to Atlas. 

**NOTE**: If you've never pushed a repository to GitHub before, follow the directions from GitHub for [Adding an existing project to GitHub using the command line](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/importing-your-projects-to-github/importing-source-code-to-github/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line).

1. Select **Add Repository**. A list of repositories in your GitHub account appears.
2. From the list of respositories, select the app with your application's code. 
3. Select **Continue**. The WP Engine Settings page appears.

## Next Steps

Next, name your app and select a deployment region. Go to [WP Engine Settings].
