Learn how to connect an Atlas application to a GitHub repository, so updates you make deploy automatically.

Atlas supports Node.js applications using popular frameworks like [Faust.js](https://faustjs.org/), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/), [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/), etc.

## 1. Connect to GitHub

Connect your GitHub account so you can connect a repo or clone Atlas blueprints.

1. In the `Repository Settings` view, select `Connect`.

2. GitHub opens in another tab of your web browser. Give WP Engine permission to access your repositories.

After Atlas connects to your GitHub account, the `Connect` button indicates that you are `Connected`. A list of repositories associated with your GitHub account appears.

## Select a repository

Now that GitHub is connected, it's time to connect your repository.

### Starting from a blueprint

If you chose “Start with Blueprint”, clone the Atlas Blueprint repo and link it to Atlas:

1. Select `Clone Blueprint`. This option opens another tab in GitHub.

2. On the `Create a new repository` page, set your new git repository settings.

- Under `Owner`, select the username you associated with your repository.
- For `Repository name`, enter a name in a format similar to `repository-name`. Avoid capitalization or spaces to make it easy to navigate your repository in the future.
- (Optional) Enter a `description` for your repository.
- Choose whether to make your repository `Public` or `Private`.
- Leave `Include all branches` unchecked.

3. With your new repository named, select `Create repository from template`.

4. Navigate back to the WP Engine User Portal by closing the GitHub tab. Select your new repository from the repository list when it refreshes.

5. Select `Continue` and move on to [App Settings](./app-settings).

### Using an existing app

If you chose “Pull from repo”, first make sure that you've pushed your application's code to your GitHub repository. If you're not familiar with pushing code to a GitHub repository, see this guide: [Adding an existing project to GitHub using the command line](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/importing-your-projects-to-github/importing-source-code-to-github/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line).

Your application needs to include a `wpe-build` script in the [`scripts`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/using-npm/scripts) field in your project's `package.json` file. It should execute the build command for your project. This is the script that the Atlas platform will execute when it builds your app.

For example, the `package.json` file for a Faust.js or Next.js app would need to be updated as shown below.

```json
  "scripts": {
    "wpe-build": "next build",
    // etc.
  },
```

If you don't know what command needs to be run to build your app, please refer to your JavaScript framework's documentation.

1. Select `Add repository`. A list of repositories in your GitHub account appears.

2. From the list of repositories, select the one with your application's code.

3. Select `Continue`. The WP Engine Settings page appears.
