title: 3. Configure Your Environment
description: Configure the environments and variables for your Atlas application.

Atlas watches a GitHub branch, then automatically deploys your environment when changes are pushed to that branch. For example, if you want to create a staging environment for your application, you could use your repository's `dev` branch.

For this tutorial, we'll create a production environment with the `main` branch.

## Set up your environment

1. From the list of your repository's branches, select the branch you want to use for the basis of your environment.

2. Fill in a name for your Atlas environment. The name should match how you intend to use the environment. For example, enter `dev` if you only want to use the environment for development purposes.

3. Every headless environment is associated with a WordPress environment via the site environment name. Choose either:

   - **I already have a WordPress environment**: Use a WordPress site from your WP Engine account. Select the search bar and search for the name of your WordPress site.
   - **I want to create a new WordPress environment**: WP Engine makes a new WordPress site and links it to your application. In the box, enter a name for your new WordPress site.

4. In order for your WordPress site to become "headless", Atlas installs the [WP GraphQL](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-graphql/) and [Atlas Content Modeler](https://my.wpengine.com/atlas#/create) plugins. If you're using the Faust.js starter kit or Faust.js plan to use Faust.js as your framework, select the **I am using Faust.js** checkbox.

**NOTE:** If you're using your existing application, you can set environment variables by selecting **Add environment variable**. See the "Environment variables (Optional)" section for more details.

5. Select **Create App**.

6. The Atlas app details page appears. When Atlas completes building your application, a checkmark appear unders **Last Build**.

7. To see your deployed Atlas application, select the **Atlas URL**. You should see your headless application in action!

## Environment variables (Optional)

If you have a front-end application and you can set your own environment variables.

For environment variables are key/value pairs. The key must be alphanumeric with no spaces, and the value can be any string input.

Environment variables are OS-level environment variables that will be available to your app during the build step (`npm run wpe-build`) and at runtime (`npm start`). In node, you can access the variables via `process.env.KEY`.

The headless framework requires two environment variables which are in your `.env.local` file:

- `WORDPRESS_URL` - The location of your WordPress instance
- `WP_HEADLESS_SECRET` - The secret found in the plugin via Settings->Atlas in WP admin.

To continue developing your application, see Atlas' [Local App Development](../local-app-development/overview) guide.
