Atlas uses a GitHub branch in your repository to double as your environment. For example, if you want to create a staging environment for your application, you could use your repository's `dev` branch. 

For this tutorial, we'll create a production environment with the `main` branch.

## Set up your environment

1. From the list of your repository's branches, select the branch you want to use for the basis of your environment.

2. Fill in a name for your Atlas environment. The name should match how you intend to use the environment. For example, enter' dev' if you only want to use the environment for development purposes. 

3. Every headless environment is associated with a WordPress environment via the site environment name. Choose either:

   - **I already have a WordPress environment**: Use a WordPress site from your WP Engine account. Select the search bar and search for the name of your WordPress site.
   - **I want to create a new WordPress environment**: WP Engine makes a new WordPress site and links it to your application. In the box, enter a name for your new WordPress site.

4. In order for your WordPress site to become "headless", Atlas installs the [WP GraphQL](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-graphql/) and [Atlas Content Modeler](https://my.wpengine.com/atlas#/create) plugins. If you're using the Faust.js starter kit or Faust.js plan to use Faust.js as your framework, select the **I am using Faust.js** checkbox.

5. Select **Create App**. 

The Atlas app details page appears. When Atlas completes building your application, three checkmarks appear under **Last Build**. To see your deployed Atlas application, select the **Atlas URL**. You should see your headless application in action!
