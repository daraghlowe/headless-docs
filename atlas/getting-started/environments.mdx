Atlas watches a GitHub branch, then automatically deploys your environment when changes are pushed to that branch. For example, if you want to create a staging environment for your application, you could use your repository's `staging` branch.

For this tutorial, we'll create a production environment with the `main` branch.

## Set Up Environment

Atlas watches a GitHub branch, then automatically deploys your environment when changes are pushed to that branch. For example, if you want to create a staging environment for your application, you could use your repository's `staging` branch.

1. From the list of your repository's branches, select the branch you want to base your environment on.

Examples:

- If you want to create a production environment, you could use your repo's `main` branch
- If you want to create a staging environment, you could use your repository's `staging` branch

2. Enter a name for your Atlas environment. The name should represent how you intend to use the environment. For example, enter something like `prod` if it's a production environment, `staging` if it's a staging environment, etc.

3. Every headless environment is associated with a WordPress environment via the site environment name. Choose either:

   - `I already have a WordPress environment`: Use a WordPress site from your WP Engine account. Select the search bar and search for the name of your WordPress site.
   - `I want to create a new WordPress environment`: WP Engine makes a new WordPress site and links it to your application. In the box, enter a name for your new WordPress site.

4. In order for your WordPress site to become "headless", Atlas installs the [WP GraphQL](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-graphql/) and [Atlas Content Modeler](https://wordpress.org/plugins/atlas-content-modeler/) plugins.
   If you're using the Faust.js Starter Kit or an existing Faust.js app repository, check the `I am using Faust.js` checkbox. This will ensure that the [FaustWP](https://wordpress.org/plugins/faustwp/) plugin is also installed.

**NOTE:** If you're using an existing application (rather than the Faust.js Starter Kit), see the [Environment variables (Optional)](#environment-variables--optional-) section below to set up environment variables before proceeding with the steps below.

5. Select `Create App`.

6. The Atlas app details page appears. When Atlas completes building your application, a checkmark appears under `Last Build`.

7. To visit your headless WordPress app once the first deploy finishes, click the link under the `Atlas URL` heading. Your Atlas app opens in a new browser tab. Enjoy!

## Set Environment Variables (Optional)

To add environment variables for your app, click `Add environment variable`.

Enter the `Key` and `Value` pairs for each environment variable.

For example, you may need to add a `NEXT_PUBLIC_WORDPRESS_URL` key with a URL as its value to specify which WordPress site should be used as the data source for the app. You may also need to specify additional environment variables to store sensitive data such as API keys and secrets.

Please refer to your JavaScript framework's documentation if you're unsure what environment variables are required for your app.

## Next Steps

If you want to make changes to the look and functionality of your app, see our [Local App Development](../local-app-development/overview) guide.
