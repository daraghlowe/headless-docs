title: Troubleshooting Builds
description: Troubleshoot your failing builds using build logs and commit history
---
In this guide, you'll learn how to troubleshoot failing builds by examining build logs and comparing logs across your commit history.

## Responding to Failed Builds

When you push new code to your Atlas project repository on GitHub and trigger a new build on the platform, you can inspect the progress of that build in realtime via the [User Portal](https://my.wpengine.com/atlas).

As the build progresses, it can either succeed or fail at any of the stages in the build -> deploy checklist. If the project fails to build, the build details on your Atlas dashboard will look like this:

Since Atlas accepts a wide variety of frontend application frameworks (Faust.js, Next.js, Nuxt, Svelte, React, Remix, etc.), there are many different ways that building a particular application could fail. Since there are few commonalities in these failure modes, this guide will focus on giving you the tools to inspect and diagnose your own app's failure state.

After you've pushed a failing build, there are quick ways to start troubleshooting your app from the Atlas dashboard: by inspecting the GitHub commit or looking at the build logs directly.

When looking at the build checklist, regardless of whether the build has failed or not, you will always have two quick links to either the commit hash, in this example `2e9121a`, that trigger the build or directly to the `Build logs` detail panel. Let's take a look at each option and how they can be used to diagnose the issues behind your failed build.

### GitHub Commit 
If you click on the commit hash link in the above screenshot, you will be taken directly to the GitHub commit diff for that particular commit. This view provides you with an easily scannable summary of everything that changed. If you scroll below your code changes, you will see an automated message from the WP Engine GitHub bot with some details about your build. It should tell you the status of the build, whether it succeeded or failed, and also provide you with links directly to the build logs and your public environment URL.
