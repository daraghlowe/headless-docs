## Relationship Field (Beta) - Cardinality

Cardinality provides a way to setup model relationship restrictions. It's a connection or reference between one or more entries of a model with one or more entries of another model. There are 4 types: One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-One, and Many-to-Many. Cardinality types that only allow one selection use a Radio button in the UI. The types that allow many use Checkboxes in the UI.
